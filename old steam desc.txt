[h1]This mod includes[/h1]
- Banana Tree (Plantable in Growing Zone)
- Bananas (Harvested from Banana Trees)
- Bananades (Banana Grenades, created at the machining table)
- Banana Meals! (Made at a stove out of bananas.)
- Banana Peels! (New! A byproduct of creating items with bananas!)
- Banana Peel Traps! (New! Found under the security tab, and made with 1 banana peel.)

[h1]Bananades[/h1]
You've heard somewhere that you could make these bananas into something a bit more... lethal.
Combining 500 bananas and 1 frag grenade weapon at a [b]machining table[/b] creates the Bananade™! (This isn't actually trademarked, please don't sue me.)

[h1]Banana Meals[/h1]

Since it would obviously it would be [b]heresy[/b] to make a banana meal without bananas, you can't.

Raw bananas are edible, and I'm planning on expanding this mod to create a whole Bananaverse™ of mods! (This isn't trademarked either, please [b] DO NOT [/b] sue me.)
